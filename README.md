# Tim config

## Install

Install homebrew with instructions from the web page, then run:
```
brew install bash iterm2 tmux nvm
```

Add to /etc/shells:
```
/opt/homebrew/bin/bash
```

Change to bash:
```
chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash
```

For iTerm you will need to open settings and set it to load the preferences
from this directory.

For Tmux you will need to install the catpuccin with:
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/tmux/plugins/catppuccin
git clone -b v2.1.3 https://github.com/catppuccin/tmux.git ~/.config/tmux/plugins/catppuccin/tmux
```
And the minimal-status-line:
```
git clone git@github.com:niksingh710/minimal-tmux-status.git ~/.config/tmux/plugins/minimal-status-line
```

To use the config files, create symbolick links to the correct location (you
may need to remove the ones that are there).

```
ln -s ~/code/config/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
ln -s ~/code/config/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
ln -s ~/code/config/witch.plist ~/Library/Application\ Support/Witch/Settings.plist
ln -s ~/code/config/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s ~/code/config/gitignore ~/.gitignore
ln -s ~/code/config/ssh_config ~/.ssh/config
ln -s ~/code/config/nvim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/code/config/firefox-user-chrome.css ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/nhn7zq27.default-release/chrome/userChrome.css
```

Also some configs require hard links:
```
ln -f ~/code/config/karabiner.json ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json
```

For NeoVim you will need to install the python provider with:
```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
```

Also the language servers:
```
npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server vscode-langservers-extracted
```

Install ripgrep for use in nvim
```
brew install ripgrep
```

Install some GUI programs by downloading them and adding the license files if
needed: Transmit, Litle Snitch, iStat Menus, Witch, Karibiner Elements,
Moom, Dash, Colima.

For Moom, you will need to import settings like this:
```
defaults import com.manytricks.Moom moom.plist
```
And when you change them, remember to export like this:
```
defaults export com.manytricks.Moom moom.plist
```

For Karabiner to work with tmux, you will need to change the hotkey for changing input sources (input language) from control space to alt space. You can do so in System Preferences > Keyboard > Input > Shortcuts

Install Colima to run containers with
```
brew install docker colima
```

Then start Colima on startup with
```
brew services start colima
```

## Helpful Information

To reload `init.vim` without exiting Neovim run
```
:source $MYVIMRC
```


## Vimium handiness

T search through tabs

leader-h -- for local history of a file

Find and replace in a directory:
```
:args spec/javascripts/**/*.* 
:argdo %s/foo/bar/g
```

## custom key mappings

not custom but dont forget: readline by word in macos is ctrl-option-f/b

s and S mappings are ripe for changing because i don't use them and they have a two character one that's directly equivalent
